# Random Martial Memes

Randomly selects recent image posts on r/MartialMemes and display their title and image. One line change and this is any subreddit you want.

## Why

Example project with ReasonML.

## Live demo

## Future Plans

* Probably none
* Really I want to generate terrible web novel quotes(including top comments from the young masters on r/MartialMemes), but the effort to compile that data sounds annoying.
  * Reddit API no longer easily allows getting all posts in a subreddit, so would need to download them ahead of time which is outside the scope of a quick Reason API call demo.

## Build

npm run build
```
