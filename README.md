### Why?

Example project with ReasonML.

### Future Plans

Really I want to generate terrible web novel quotes, but the effort to compile that data sounds annoying.

## Basic Reason Template

Hello! This project allows you to quickly get started with Reason and BuckleScript. If you wanted a more sophisticated version, try the `react` template (`bsb -theme react -init .`).

## Build

```bash
# for yarn
yarn build

# for npm
npm run build
```

## Build + Watch

```bash
# for yarn
yarn

# for npm
npm run start
```
